# The Healing Harbor
With academic pressures, social expectations, and personal responsibilities, mental health issues have largely increased nowadays, especially among university students. However, people may find it difficult to seek help due to stigmas and other concerns. A counselling platform is essential as many people may not have access to them due to geographic location, time constraints, or cost. By providing an accessible and affordable counselling platform, more people may be encouraged to seek help and receive the support they need as the platform can provide resources and guidance to help individuals manage their mental health and reduce their mental strain.

## How we built it
We used an open-source web framework called Django that is used to build web applications quickly and efficiently. The programming languages we used is Python, along with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Lastly, we combined our codes using GitHub and hosted it using PythonAnywhere.

## Challenges we ran into
1. Complicated URL routing in Django due to too many webpages
2. Getting familiar with GitHub
3. Getting more familiar with Django database
4. Uploading profile picture using Pillow module
5. Setting authentication and authorization for different types of users
